## TASK TO PERFORM

### Note:
upload your code to your GitHub account

### 1. Stock Prediction:
Take the stock price of any company you 
want and predict its price by using LSTM.
Use only Jupyter notebook code.

### 2. Titanic Classification:
Make a system which tells whether the person will be
Save it from sinking. What factors were
most likely lead to success-socio-economic
status, age, gender, and more.

### 3. Number Recognition:
The handwritten digit recognition system not only detects
scanned images of handwritten digits. Handwritten digit
recognition using the MNIST dataset is a major project made
with the help of Neural Networks. It basically detects
the scanned images of handwritten digits.

#### Out of these three tasks, we must complete at least two. So we are choosing Stock Prediction and Number Recognition.
